## CONTRIBUTIONS

Contributions are welcome!

Something's wrong with the repo or you know better workarounds and alternatives? You can fork the repo and make a pull request. It will be very much appreciated!

You are welcome to introduce any changes to the repo. However, I do have to focus on the following:
- The caveats at [Dependencies](https://github.com/NeKoRoSYS/NeKoRoSHELL#dependencies)
- The [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/NeKoRoSYS/NeKoRoSHELL/issues)

## Sponsorship
I am an aspiring software and game developer that currently do stuff solo. [Buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/nekorosys) is not a must, but it will be immensely cherished and appreciated! Editing code and files is not the only way you can contribute to the project :D
