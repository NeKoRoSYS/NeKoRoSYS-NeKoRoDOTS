# NeKoRoSYS-Arch-Linux-Rice
Based on mkhmtolzhas' rice. Meant for personal use only.

## Notes
- This repo assumes you already installed base-devel, git, flatpak, and yay.
- This repo assumes you have turned on mirror link downloads for pacman.
- After installing pip, install haishoku and colorthief for pywal.
- Don't be scared if sed says it can't read a file or directory in the installer. It's part of the function to replace every occurence of "/home/nekorosys" with your username" and it simply cant find one at those locations.
- **IMPORTANT!** You can freely customize flatpak.txt and pkglist.txt

## Other Dependencies (Read them to install properly)
- Assuming sddm is installed, use this https://github.com/uiriansan/SilentSDDM as a theme
- Auto-stop animated wallpapers https://github.com/pvtoari/mpvpaper-stop (dependencies: cmake, cjson)
